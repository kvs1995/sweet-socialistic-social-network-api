# Sweet Socialistic Social Networking API [![MIT License](<https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg>)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

  In this application, I have created a simple social networking backend application! This project allows users to add friends and thoughts to their user profile. Additionally, you can comment your reaction to your friend's thoughts.  

## **DISCLAIMER:** Unfortunately, the application that I typically utilize to create my gifs and walkthrough videos is no longer compatible with my machine so I was unable to provide the assets I would have liked to.

  The only installation needed is to run `npm i` in the terminal once the repo is cloned. After the installation, run `npm start`. 

  ## Usage
  This is a basis for a social networking api that has the potentially to hav a front end connected and expanded in functionality on the backend. 
  
  Take a look at this short video for a walkthrough on how to use the application:

## Walkthrough


To view the walkthrough video: Please go to the Assets folder, then go to WALKTHROUGH.mov. The file must be opened from a Finder as it is not able to play in VSCode. 

Below, I have provided screenshots of the Insomnia functionality.

The following animations show examples of the application's API routes being tested in Insomnia.

The following animation shows GET routes to return all users and all thoughts being tested in Insomnia:
